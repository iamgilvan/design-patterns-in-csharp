// Composition vs Inheritance

// When to Use Composition:

// When you need more flexibility in contructing objects by assembling smaller, reusable components.
// when there is no clear 'is-a' relationship between classes , and a 'has-a' relationship is more appropriate.
// When you want to avoid the limitations of inheritance, such as tight coupling and the fragilebase class problem - wich we will look into shortly.


// When to Use Inheritance:

// When there is a clear 'is-a' relationship between classes, and subclass objects can be treated as intances of their superclass.
// When you want to promote code reuse by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes
// when you want to leverage polymorphism to allow objects of different subclasses to be treated uniformly through their common superclass interface
